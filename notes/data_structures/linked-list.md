##### Linked Lists:
- Are comprised of nodes
- The nodes contain a link to the next node (and also the previous node for bidirectional linked lists)
- Can be unidirectional or bidirectional
- Are a basic data structure, and form the basis for many other data structures
- Have a single head node, which serves as the first node in the list
- Require some maintenance in order to add or remove nodes
- Nodes are not located sequentially in memory like arrays since they use pointers
  - Allows for quick insertions/removals
##### Common Functions on Linked Lists:
- get the head node of the list (itâ€™s like peeking at the first item in line)
- add a new node to the beginning of the list
- print out the list values in order
- remove a node that has a particular value
