picture or visualization

## Purpose

why does it exist?

why would you ever choose this over other data structures?

common 

what is the data structure optimized for? insertions/deletion? resizing? etc?


### Advantages

### Disadvantages

## Big O Analysis

| Operation | Big O | Explanation |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| insertion | O(1) | just change the pointers of each node to insert |

## Code 

## Next Steps:
- Anki flashcards from the notes
- Apply to problems that are designed for that data structure
- Apply to random problems that may or may not use the data structure (so you can begin to find patterns of when to apply the data structure)
