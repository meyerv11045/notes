##### Stacks
- Implemented using Linked Lists b/c it is more efficient than lists/arrays
- Contain data nodes
- *Push* adds data to the top of the stack
- *Pop* removes and provides data from the top of the stack
- *Peek* reveals data on the top of the stack
- Can have a limited size
- Pushing data onto a full stack results in a stack overflow
- Stacks process data Last In, First Out (LIFO)
