# 3D Modeling and Printing

### Process
1. Design or download a model (.stl file)
2. Import the stl file(s) to slicing software (e.g. IdeaMaker)
3. Slice the object
4. Slicing takes the model and does the math on it to create gcode instructions for the 3D printer
5. Export the gcode instructions to a usb drive or SD card depending on the printer
6. Plug in drive to printer and begin the 3D print

### Notes
- PLA is a common plastic used b/c it is softer (less wear & tear on printer) and needs less heat to be melted
- ABS is a harder plastic that is used and thus requires more heat to melt it
- A variety of different filaments can be used to print things
- Tiny errors in a 3D printerâ€™s movement results in big errors with the print b/c movements are done hundreds of times

# Raspberry Pi

### Board Structure
- Set of GPIO pins (General purpose input-output pins) [Read More](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/)
- Serial pin on TX (GPIO14) and RX (GPIO15)
- Can print out [this](https://github.com/splitbrain/rpibplusleaf) and place on pi for reference
- [Interactive GPIO Guide](https://pinout.xyz/)

### Pi Camera
- Watch out, static can kill it
- FIX PI CAMERA DETECTION ERROR by enabling the I2C Interface in preferences --> raspberry pi configuration 

# Quartus
Software used for designing circuits and implementing them on a board such as the FPGA used in lab.

## Project Structure
- Digital systems lab folder/project
- Within the folder each design follows the format `lab#design#.bdf`
    -  `.bdf` stands for block design format

## Simulating a Circuit
- Create a new `University Program VWF` (vector waveform file)
- Place in the project's directory
- Setup scaling:
    - Set end time to be 16 micro/nano seconds
    - Set grid time to be 1 micro/nano seconds
    - View -> Fit in Window
- Insert all the input and output nodes
    - Only ones that were compiled will show up
- Edit -> Value -> Overwrite Clock (Ctrl + Alt + K) to set the period to 2 microseconds, 4 microseconds, etc. 
    - This simulates counting and is setup manually
    - can setup automatic counting by grouping inputs together
- Simulation -> Run Functional Simulation
    - Will create several new files and display the output waveform as readonly
    - This is how you can verify your circuit worked correctly
