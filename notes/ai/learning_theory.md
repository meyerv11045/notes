- machine learning is more accurately: machine inductive inference
    - that is, machines make predictions based on a series of observations (the training data)
- there have been attempts at more deductive reasoning machines
    - Making predictions based on a set of rules all predictions must follow (inductive systems learn approximations of these rules through observing lots of training data)
