The average adult brain weighs about 3 lbs which is roughly 2% of total body weight. However it requires 20% of the total amount of energy our bodies spend in a day of no activity. This means it takes roughly 13 watts to power the brain. To put things in perspective, this is 1/5 of the power required by a standard 60 watt lightbulb.

When compared to even the most impressive computers-- IBM's Watson which runs on a supercomputer that requires around 1,000 watts-- the brains ability computational ability compared to power consumption is remarkable.

## The Neuron
Our brain is comprised of an estimated 100 billion neurons that operate together in order to produce behavior by transmitting and integrating information at the individual level. Each neuron is connected to roughly 50,000 others.

A neuron is comprised of 3 main parts:
1. Dendrites- "input" side that receives signals from many other neurons
2. Cell Body- contains the nucleus and all elements needed for normal metabolic activities of these cells
3. Axon- "output" side that transmitts neural impulses to other neurons

There are many varities of neurons that range in size from 5 microns in diameter to 100 microns-- the size of a human hair in diameter. The 3 main types of neurons are the following:

1. Efferent Neurons- carry information outward from the central nervous system
2. Afferent Neurons- carry information from the external world and body's internal environment inward to the central nervous system
3. Interneurons- carry information from one neuron to another and comprise 99% of neurons in the brain

## How are signals transferrred? 
The science behind how electrical signals are transferred in the brain involves some physics and biology. 

Cells have a higher concentration of positive ions on the outside than the inside which creates a higher potential on the outside. The $V_out = 0 mV$ while $V_in = -70 mV$.

At the peak of the potential inside the nerve cell, the positive charges begin moving down the axon in order to maximize the distance between positive ions. This is the start of an electrical signal being transmitted.

The myelin sheath which has a high resisitvity and covers the axon keeps the positive ions trapped, preventing the signal from disappating. 

Gaps in the myelin sheath called nodes of ranvier contain voltage gated sodium pumps that repeat the same process as above with the action potential when the electrical charge signal, helping to push the electrical signal further down the axon.

The myelin sheath combined with nodes of ranvier allow for the electrical signal to be transmitted at very high speeds. These transmissions of electrical signals form the basis for all activity and computation done by the brain.

While there are always things to further understand such as why sodium pumps work or the quantum mechanics behind the movement of electrons, we use layers of abstraction to allow us to build up understanding of certain aspects without having to understand every single thing that makes something occur. Abstraction is the key to making things understandable to humans and is critical in many fields outside of CS/EE in areas such as bio where complex phenomena can be studied at varying levels of abstraction in order to gain different insights.

Its pretty meta when you think about how a brain is creating these layers of abstraction just so it can think about how itself works and begin to have an understanding of what it means to think.

## Brain Diseases
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease where damage is done to the myelin sheaths in the brain, making it difficult for signals to travel, thus causing a breakdown in many critical functions such as muscle control.
