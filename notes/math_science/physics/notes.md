# Voltage
The electric potential energy difference per unit charge. 

1 volt = 1 J / 1 C.

1 volt represents 1 Joule of electric potential energy per 1 Coloumb of charge.

5 volts represent 5 joules of potential energy per coloumb meaning each charge carries 5 joules of potential energy

higher voltage means the electrons have more energy

final - initial

# current
is the flow of charge per unit charge

1 Amp = 1 C / 1 s

5 Amp = 5 C / 1s meaning 5 coloumbs of charge are flowing per second

analogous rate of flow of water

# resistance 
measure of materials' ability to resist the flow of charges (current)

longer wire will have a greater resistance than a shorter wire because the electrons will have to travel through more material, meaning they will run into more obstacles

thin wire will have larger resistance than thick wire since more electrons can get through a thicker wire

resistance and current are inversely relateed

# ohm's law
Relates voltage, resistance, and current

$$V = IR$$ 

current flows from high potential to low potential 

electrons actually travel in the opposite direction of current (direction of current travel can be thought of as the direction of travel of imaginary positive charges)

increasing the voltage will increase the current

increasing the resistance will decrease the current

# capacitors

## capacitors in parallel
- Equivalent capcitance is the sum of individual capacitances
- **Voltage is same across all capacitors in parallel**
- Follows that the total charge is the equivalent capacitance times the voltage  
- potential energy in a capacitor is $U = 1/2 CV^2$


## capacitors in series
- inverses for equivalent capacitance
- series => diff voltage across capacitor if diff capacitance
- **charge stored on each capacitor is the same for capacitors in series**

# dielectrics and capacitors
when a circuit is *not connected to a battery*, inserting a dielectric will increase capacitance by a factor of K and decrease potential by a factor of K meaning charge remains the same due to Q = KV. 
Since E = V/l, decreasing V by a factor of K also decreases E by a factor of K

When a circuit is *connected to a battery*, inserting a dielectric will increase the capacitane by a factor of K.=

Voltage will remain the same as before due to the battery recharging the initial decrease in voltage so that it stays consistent with the potential supplied by the battery. Therefore, electric field will also be the same since voltae remains the same.

In this case, charge will increase with the increase in capacitance. The increase in charge by factor of K will result in an increase of potential energy by a factor of K since $U = 1/2 Q V$.
