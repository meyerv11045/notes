# Developmental Psychology

## Essential Messages & Policy:
- Essential messages came from neuroscientists, developmental psychologists, pediatricians, economists, & educators
- Each essential message represents a mountain of research 
- Economists were involved b/c research shows money spent early in child’s life pays off (informs policies targeted at children)
- Psychology & neuroscience research can be used to inform policy
- Policies aim to:
    - 1) Prep young children for school
    - 2) Provide best forms of child care
    - 3) Improve well-being of children growing up in poverty
    - 4) Protect those who have been abused/neglected

## The Brain:
- Not enough genetic material to specify all the synaptic connections in the brain
- Most neurons are place at birth with few connections/synapses
- Brains builds connections with experience
    - Brains initially overproduces synapses and then prunes/discards half of them by adolescence (if the connections are not used, they are lost)
- Takeaway from neurobiology research:
    - *Early experiences shape the architecture of the baby’s brain (Firm foundations)*

## Toxic Stress:
- Healthy development depends on stress response systems being able to quickly ramp up and then return to baseline
- Children raised in chronic stress (e.g. poverty) keep these systems activated and that can damage brain architecture and regulatory systems
    - Lead to policy outcome of low-income kids being prescribed medicine at a much higher rate to combat psychological related behavioral problems
