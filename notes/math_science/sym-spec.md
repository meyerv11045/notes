# The Symbolic Species

## Ch. 1

- Many animals have communication systems that do not involve language
- What is the origin of language in humans?
- Why only in humans?
    - not because of its complexity- we don't even see simple languages in animal species that are less complex than the non-language communication system they use
    - likely because of how language involves representations of objects/concepts as symbols and how these symbols are related is the key part of the language
