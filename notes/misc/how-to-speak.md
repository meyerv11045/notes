# How to Speak

Notes from the [legendary lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY) by MIT professor Patrick Winston. [Article](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/emotional-intelligence-mit-patrick-winston-how-to-communicate-effectively-how-to-write.html) on his advice.

- Success in life mostly depends on :
    1. your ability to speak
    2. your ability to write
    3. the quality of your ideas 

- Quality of your communication depends mostly on how much you know (your knowledge), some on how much you practice, and a only a tiny bit on talent
    - Can be better than people with inherent talent by having the right amount of knowledge

## Giving a Talk

- dont start with a joke for a talk	
    - people are still getting settled in and don't really understand your way of speaking yet
- start with a promise of what people will know at the end of the talk (empowerment promise)
- cycle around a subject (repeat your point)
- build a fence around your idea so it can be distinguished from other people's ideas
    - helps to prevent confusion on how your idea is different
- need verbal punctuation
    - give people a place to get back on the talk if they zoned out or something 
- when asking a question
    - need to wait 7 seconds for responses
    - too easy and people will be embarrased to respond
    - too hard and people can't respond
- time and place for a talk:
    - best time for a talk: 11am (people are awake and not too hungry or too full)
    - need a talk to be well lit 
    - case the place you will be speaking so you can anticipate any challenges 
    - get a place where the size of the anticipated audience will not seem too small for the place
- Inspire people
    - most inspiring thing for people is to see someone talk about something they are passionate about
- when talking about your research, you need to give context as to why you are doing it
- don't practice on people that know the material b/c they might fill in the gaps  in your presentation on their own 
- in a job talk you need to do both within 5 min:
    - express your vision (the problem and your approach)
    - show you've done something (enumerate the steps to reach the vision and talk about your contribution to these steps)
- your ideas are like your children so you want to ready them for the world
    - thats why packaging them properly is important for their success
- in order for your work to get recognized it needs a:
    - symbol
    - slogan
    - surprise (e.g. suprising result)
    - salient (an idea that sticks out)
    - story (need to tell story of how you did it, how it works, why its important)

## Tools

- board:
    - graphics fast and easy to make
    - speed you can go is the speed people can absorb (slides can be too fast)
    - you have something to do with your hands
    - good for informing

- props are great at demonstrating things 
- slides
    - always too many words on the slide
        - too many words on slide forces audience to disengage from listening in order to read
        - using big font sizes helps force less words and improves readability for the audience
    - dont read the slide 
    - slides with words and a far away speaker can pull the audience's attention in different directions
        - be near the slides
    - reduce the background junk and keep images simple
        - e.g. get rid of logos and even titles
    - good for exposing ideas
    - using a laser pointer forces you to lose contact with audience
        - better to use labels like arrows in the slideshow/ppt for emphasis
    - final slide:
        - recognize collaborators on 1st slide, not last slide
        - don't do: 
            - questions? 
            - go to this website for more details slide
            - the end or thank you 
        -  should be your contributions 
        - a joke at the end could work and be better well received than at the beginning 
        - saying thank you for listening is a weak last move (implies you were not interesting) 
            - can say/mouth thanks during the applause
        - can end by saluting the audience verbally
