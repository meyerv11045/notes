# Matrix Factorization/Decomposition

- Method for reducing a matrix into its constituent parts
- Can simplify complex matrix operations to make more efficient on computers
- [Intro for ML](https://machinelearningmastery.com/introduction-to-matrix-decompositions-for-machine-learning/)

## LU Decomposition

- For a square matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, $A = LU$ 
    - $L$ is the lower triangle matrix
    - $U$ is the upper triangle matrix
- Other variations exist like LUP decomposition that are more numerically stable and work for more matrices
