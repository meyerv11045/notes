# Linear Algebra

- The column space of a matrix is the span of its column vectors
    - $rank(A) = dim(col(A))$
- elementary row operations are the matrix equivalent to the techniques used in the elimination method for solving systems of linear equations. therefore performing row operations on a matrix does not change the solution set of the corresponding linear equations

## Variational Viewpoint

- can recast many problems as optimization problems 
- solvigng $Ax = b$ can be treated as solving $\min_x ||Ax - b||^2$
