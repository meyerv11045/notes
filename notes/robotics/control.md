# Control Systems

- Open-Loop Control- control action from controller is independent of the process variable 
    - Ex: central heating boiler controlled only by timer
- Closed-Loop Control- control action from the controller is dependent on the desired and actual/measured process variable
    - Ex: central heating boiler controlled by signal from thermostat in the building to maintain a desired temperature
    - AKA feedback controllers
