# Ch. 1 

## The 3 y's
1. Hierarchy- a system is divided into modules and submodules 
2. Modularity- having well-defined functions and interfaces
3. Regularity- encourages uniformity so modules can be easily reused

## Binary 
- Digital systems use discrete values of 1 and 0 and to represent data compared to analog systems which use continuous values
    - 1: TRUE, HIGH (voltage)
    - 0: FALSE, LOW (voltage)
- Digital sytems use voltage levels to represent 1 and 0 

## Hexadecimal

## Signed Binary Numbers
unsigned represent ositive numbers
- Sign/Magnitude numbers
  - N bits: 1 sign bit, N-1 magnitude bits
