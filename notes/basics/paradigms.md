## What is a Programming Paradigm?

- A style of programming/way of thinking about software architecture
- A way/methodology, not a language
- Some languages are better for some paradigms than others 

## Functional Programming (FP):

- Treats computation as the the evaluation of math functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
- Passing data from function to function to get a result
- Functions are threatened as data (you can use them as parameters, return them, build functions from other functions, and build custom functions
- Have to be pure functions- not dependent on local/global states  
- Good for modularity since each function will return the same output given the same input 

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP):

- Based on the concept of “objects” which may contain data in the form of fields/attributes and code in the form of procedures/methods 
- Encapsulating data & behavior into objects that interact with other elements and can perform certain actions 
- More details in aother note section

## Procedural Programming (PP):

- Based on the concept of procedure call where procedures/routines/subroutines/functions simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out • 
- AKA inline programming and it takes a top-down approach • 
- Writing a list of instructions to tell the computer what to do step by step 
  - Relies on procedures/routines
