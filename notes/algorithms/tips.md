# Writers Workshop

- Work out examples to get a rough idea for an algorithm (might not be most efficient but can improve from there) since solving the examples, your brain is using an algorithm

- Always can start with brute force 
  1. might gain insight into problem 
  2. will realize where unecessary work can be removed 
  3. might be only choice in some cases

- Have to explore and refine find, go, delete keywords and explain how long they will take 

- Try to break your algorithm with different examples
